# README

This is a personal fork of the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) binary distribution, found at http://www.magpcss.net/cef_downloads/. To make it work properly with the VS2010 and VS2012 version of [CefSharp](http://github.com/perlun/CefSharp), we need to do some local modifications to make the project compile properly. This purpose of this repository is to track and maintain these modifications.

The original README for CEF can be found here: [README.txt](README.txt).
